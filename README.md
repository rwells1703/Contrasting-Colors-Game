**About the jam:** <br>
The theme for the game jam was "contrasting elements", hence the name of the game. <br>
We also took on the hardmode challenge, of making all the sound effects with our mouths.
Geta Game Jam 9 ran from August 23rd 2019 to August 26th 2019 (3 days), and was hosted online. <br>

**Our tools:** <br>
We decided to use JavaScript with Phaser 3 (https://phaser.io/) as a game framework - mostly as it was cross platform and most of us had experience with JavaScript before. <br>
Using Git to collaborate on a project was also new to most of us, so we also had to learn that alongside the game framework.
